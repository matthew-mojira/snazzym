; not a real program, just an idea of what it should look like

; library import
(import "../file.snm")

; constants
(define x 12)
  ; the idea is that they should be substituted directly into the program
  ; whenever used

; array type


; ROM inclusions
(include tilemap "tilemap.bin")


; Biggest needs:
; - error messages
; - new type system
; - organizational moves in the compiler
; - macro/inlined functions system
